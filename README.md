# Image-Classification-of-Fashion-Items
This guide uses the Fashion MNIST dataset which contains 60,000 grayscale images in 10 categories. The images show individual articles of clothing at 28 by 28 NumPy arrays, with pixel values ranging between 0 and 255. The labels are an array of integers, ranging from 0 to 9. These correspond to the class of clothing the image represents.
